  * Correct number of drives is now returned from AH=08h even when it is redirected to foreign BIOS.


XTIDE Universal BIOS v1.1.3 (1 August 2010)
  * v1.1.1 broke booting from foreign drives, it is now fixed.
  * Improved error handling a bit.
  * Longer DRQ and IRQ timeouts to minimize write timouts with some (bad) CF cards.
  * Default boot menu drive should now be properly selected.


XTIDE Universal BIOS v1.1.2 (26 July 2010, no public release)
  * Fixed a bug where Disk Parameter Table was accessed with wrong pointer register after writing last block.
  * Cleaned AH=00h, Disk Controller Reset a bit.


XTIDE Universal BIOS v1.1.1 (19 July 2010)
*Booting is now possible from hard disks if floppy controller reset fails
 since AH=00h, Disk Controller Reset now returns error code for the
 requested drive only.
*Now assembles with Yasm.


XTIDE Universal BIOS v1.1.0 (first stable release, 2 May 2010)
*Lite and full operating modes
*Diagnostic cylinder no longer has to be reserved
*Slave drives again work without master present
*32-bit transfers for VLB and PCI IDE controllers
*16- and 32-bit transfers are enabled on all builds
*Boot menu hotkeys for all drives
*Drive swapping is handled separately for floppy and hard disk drives so it
 is now possible to install DOS to any hard disk from any floppy drive
*INT 13h,AH=15h return value in DL now longer gets corrupted by drive swapping
*Rewritten drive detection and lots of code cleaning
*Longer timeout when detecting first drive
*Minimum number of floppy drives can be specified if autodetection fails
*Maybe other changes that i have forgotten

XTIDE Universal BIOS v1.1.0 configuration and flashing program (idecfg.com)
*Now works as a generic EEPROM flasher
*Improvements to configuration menus
*SDP can be completely disabled


XTIDE Universal BIOS v1.0.0_RC2
*No more boot menu slowdown when no XTIDE Universal BIOS
 controlled drives present
*Hard disks are now reset properly.
 This fixes some Block Mode related bugs.
*Major improvements for error handling
*Small improvements for interrupt handling


XTIDE Universal BIOS v1.0.0_RC1
*Fixed 386+ stack exception bug
*Stack is relocated for boot menu even if DPTs are not stored to 30:0h
*Strings and boot menu are displayed properly on BIOSes that corrupts
 AH when returning from INT 10h/AH=Eh
*L-CHS addressing is now used for <=504MiB drives even if LBA is supported


XTIDE Universal BIOS v1.0.0_b4
*Boot menu with drive swapping
*Block mode transfers
*Cylinder limiting
*Drive detection read errors are now properly detected
*A little longer timeout value when detecting drives
*Minor optimizations to save some bytes


XTIDE Universal BIOS beta3
*BIOS configuration and flashing program finally available
*No more conflicts with other hard disk BIOSes
*Slave drives should now be detected without master
*Timeouts now use system timer
*Variables can now be located to top of base memory
*Completely rewritten interrupt handling
*Minor optimizations to 8-bit transfers
*CTRL can be held down to skip initialization
*Late initialization to fix compatibility issues with old systems


XTIDE Universal BIOS beta2
*AT build and support for 16-bit IDE Controllers
*XT+ build for 188/186/V20/V30/286 XTs
*Auto detection for timeout values (AT+)
*Minor optimizations


XTIDE Universal BIOS beta1
*Initial release

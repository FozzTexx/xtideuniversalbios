# XTIDE Universal BIOS #

XTIDE Universal BIOS makes it possible to use modern large ATA hard disks or Compact Flash cards on old PC's. You can then enjoy quiet or noiseless drives with more capacity than you'll ever need for old computers.

XTIDE Universal BIOS can be used on any IBM PC, XT, AT or 100% compatible system. On AT systems you can use any 16-bit ISA or VLB IDE or Multi I/O controller. For XT systems you can use XTIDE rev1 (not available anymore), [XTIDE rev2](http://www.vintage-computer.com/vcforum/showthread.php?29202-XTIDE-Rev2) or [JR-IDE/ISA](https://www.retrotronics.org/home-page/jride/). If you want to use CF cards or Microdrives and do not need hard drive support, then [Lo-Tech XT-CF](http://www.lo-tech.co.uk/) is the best option.

Official beta releases are now quite old. It is recommended to use SVN builds before new beta is released (unknown when this happens). [Thanks to James Pearce from lo-tech to host SVN builds here](http://www.lo-tech.co.uk/wiki/XTIDE_Universal_BIOS).
